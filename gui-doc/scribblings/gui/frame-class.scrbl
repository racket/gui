@defclass/title[frame% object% (top-level-window<%>)]{

A frame is a top-level container window. It has a title bar (which
 displays the frame's label), an optional menu bar, and an optional
 status line.

The @racket[label] string is displayed in the frame's title
bar. If the frame's label is changed (see @method[window<%>
set-label]), the title bar is updated.

The @racket[parent] argument can be @racket[#f] or an existing
frame. On Windows, if @racket[parent] is an existing frame,
the new frame is always on top of its parent.
On Windows and Unix (for many window managers), a
frame is iconized when its parent is iconized.

If @racket[parent] is @racket[#f], then the eventspace for the
new frame is the current eventspace, as determined by
@racket[current-eventspace]. Otherwise, @racket[parent]'s
eventspace is the new frame's eventspace.

If the @racket[width] or @racket[height] argument is not
@racket[#f], it specifies an initial size for the frame (in
pixels) assuming that it is larger than the minimum size,
otherwise the minimum size is used.

If the @racket[x] or @racket[y] argument is not @racket[#f], it
specifies an initial location for the frame. Otherwise, a
location is selected automatically (tiling frames and dialogs as
they are created).

The @racket[style] flags adjust the appearance of the frame on
some platforms:

@itemize[

 @item{@racket['no-resize-border] --- omits the resizeable border
  around the window (Windows, Unix), ability to resize the window (Mac
  OS X), or grow box in the bottom right corner (older Mac OS X)}

 @item{@racket['no-caption] --- omits the title bar for the frame
 (Windows, Mac OS X, Unix)}

 @item{@racket['no-system-menu] --- omits the system menu
 (Windows)}

 @item{@racket['toolbar-button] --- includes a toolbar button on the
 frame's title bar (Mac OS X 10.6 and earlier); a click on the toolbar button triggers
 a call to @method[frame% on-toolbar-button-click]}

 @item{@racket['hide-menu-bar] --- hides the menu bar and dock when
 the frame is active (Mac OS X) or asks the window manager to make
 the frame fullscreen (Unix)}

 @item{@racket['float] --- causes the frame to stay in front of all
 other non-floating windows (Windows, Mac OS X, Unix); on Mac OS X, a floating frame
 shares the focus with an active non-floating frame; when this style
 is combined with @racket['no-caption], then showing the frame does
 not cause the keyboard focus to shift to the window, and on Unix,
 clicking the frame does not move the focus; on Windows, a floating
 frame has no taskbar button}

 @item{@racket['metal] --- ignored (formerly supported for Mac OS X)}

 @item{@racket['fullscreen-button] --- includes a button on the
 frame's title bar to put the frame in fullscreen mode (Mac OS X 10.7 and later)}

 @item{@racket['fullscreen-aux] --- allows the frame to accompany
 another that is in fullscreen mode (Mac OS X 10.7 and later)}

]

Even if the frame is not shown, a few notification events may be
 queued for the frame on creation. Consequently, the new frame's
 resources (e.g., memory) cannot be reclaimed until some events are
 handled, or the frame's eventspace is shut down.

}


@defmethod[(create-status-line)
           void?]{

Creates a status line at the bottom of the frame. The width of the
 status line is the whole width of the frame (adjusted automatically
 when resizing), and the height and text size are platform-specific.

See also @method[frame% set-status-text].

}

@defmethod[(fullscreen [fullscreen? any/c])
           void?]{

Puts the frame in fullscreen mode or restores the frame to
 non-fullscreen mode (Mac OS X, Windows).

@Unmonitored[@elem{A frame's mode} @elem{the user} @elem{a
frame has been put in fullscreen mode} @elem{@method[frame% is-fullscreened?]}]

}

@defmethod[(get-menu-bar)
           (or/c (is-a?/c menu-bar%) #f)]{

Returns the frame's menu bar, or @racket[#f] if none has been created
 for the frame.

}

@defmethod[(has-status-line?)
           boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if the frame's status line has been created,
 @racket[#f] otherwise. See also @method[frame% create-status-line].

}

@defmethod[(iconize [iconize? any/c])
           void?]{

Iconizes (@as-index{minimizes}) or deiconizes (restores) the
 frame. Deiconizing brings the frame to the front.

@Unmonitored[@elem{A frame's iconization} @elem{the user} @elem{a
frame has been iconized} @elem{@method[frame% is-iconized?]}]

}

@defmethod[(is-fullscreened?)
           boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if the frame is in fullscreen mode (Mac OS X, Windows), @racket[#f]
otherwise.

@history[#:added "6.0.0.6"]
}

@defmethod[(is-iconized?)
           boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if the frame is iconized (minimized), @racket[#f]
otherwise.

}

@defmethod[(is-maximized?)
           boolean?]{

On Windows and Mac OS X, returns @racket[#t] if the frame is
maximized, @racket[#f] otherwise. On Unix, the result is always
@racket[#f].

}

@defmethod[(maximize [maximize? any/c])
           void?]{
@methspec{

Maximizes or restores the frame on Windows and Mac OS X; the
 frame's show state is not affected. On Windows, an iconized frame
 cannot be maximized or restored.

@MonitorMethod[@elem{A window's maximization} @elem{the user} @elem{@method[window<%> on-size]} @elem{size}]

}
@methimpl{

If @racket[maximize?] is @racket[#f], the window is restored, otherwise
 it is maximized.

@defmethod*[([(modified)
              boolean?]
             [(modified [modified? any/c])
              void?])]{

Gets or sets the frame's modification state as reflected to the user.
 On Mac OS X, the modification state is reflected as a dot in the
 frame's close button. On Windows and Unix, the modification state is
 reflected by an asterisk at the end of the frame's displayed title.

}

@defmethod[(on-menu-char [event (is-a?/c key-event%)])
           boolean?]{

If the frame has a menu bar with keyboard shortcuts, and if the key
event includes a Control, Alt, Option, Meta, Command, Shift, or
Function key, then @method[frame% on-menu-char] attempts to match the
given event to a menu item. If a match is found, @racket[#t] is
returned, otherwise @racket[#f] is returned.

When the match corresponds to a complete shortcut combination, the
 menu item's callback is called (before
@method[frame% on-menu-char] returns).

If the event does not correspond to a complete shortcut combination,
 the event may be handled anyway if it corresponds to a mnemonic in the
 menu bar (i.e., an underlined letter in a menu's title, which is
 installed by including an ampersand in the menu's label). If a
 mnemonic match is found, the keyboard focus is moved to the menu bar
 (selecting the menu with the mnemonic), and @racket[#t] is returned.

}

                              [event (is-a?/c key-event%)])
           boolean?]{

Returns the result of

@racketblock[

    (send this @#,method[top-level-window<%> on-system-menu-char] event)
    (send this @#,method[top-level-window<%> on-traverse-char] event))
]
}

@defmethod[(on-toolbar-button-click)
           void?]{

On Mac OS X, called when the user clicks the toolbar button on a
 frame created with the @indexed-racket['toolbar-button] style.

}

@defmethod[(set-status-text [text string?])
           void?]{

Sets the frame's status line text and redraws the status line. See
 also @method[frame% create-status-line].
