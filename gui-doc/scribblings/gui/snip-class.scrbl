A direct instance of @racket[snip%] is uninteresting. Useful snips are
 defined by instantiating derived subclasses, but the @racket[snip%] class defines
 the basic functionality. See @secref["snip-example"] for more information about
 deriving a new snip class.

@methspec{

Called (by an editor) to draw the snip into the given drawing context
 with the snip's top left corner at @techlink{location} (@racket[x],
 @racket[y]) in DC coordinates.

The arguments @racket[left], @racket[top], @racket[right], and @racket[bottom]
 define a clipping region (in DC coordinates) that the snip can use to
 optimize drawing, but it can also ignore these arguments.

The @racket[dx] and @racket[dy] argument provide numbers that can be
 subtracted from @racket[x] and @racket[y] to obtain the snip's @techlink{location} in
 editor coordinates (as opposed to DC coordinates, which are used for
 drawing).

See @|drawcaretdiscuss| for information about
@racket[draw-caret]. When @racket[draw-caret] is a pair, refrain from
drawing a background for the selected region, and if
@racket[(get-highlight-text-color)] returns a color (instead of @racket[#f]),
use that color for drawing selected text and other selected foreground elements.

Before this method is called, the font, text color, and pen color for
 the snip's style will have been set in the drawing context.  (The
 drawing context is @italic{not} so configured for @method[snip%
 get-extent] or @method[snip% partial-offset].)  The @method[snip% draw] method must
 not make any other assumptions about the state of the drawing
 context, except that the clipping region is already set to something
 appropriate. Before @method[snip% draw] returns, it must restore any
 drawing context settings that it changes.

See also @xmethod[editor<%> on-paint].

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for
 writing and reflowing when this method is called
 (see also @|lockdiscuss|), and it is normally in a refresh (see 
 @secref["editorthreads"]).

@methspec{

Calculates the snip's width, height, descent (amount of height which
 is drawn below the baseline), space (amount of height which is
 ``filler'' space at the top), and horizontal spaces (amount of width
 which is ``filler'' space at the left and right). Those values are
 returned by filling the @racket[w], @racket[h], @racket[descent],
 @racket[space], @racket[lspace], and @racket[rspace] boxes.

This method is called by the snip's administrator; it is not normally
 called directly by others. To get the extent of a snip, use
 @xmethod[editor<%> get-snip-location] .

A drawing context is provided for the purpose of finding font sizes,
 but no drawing should occur. The @method[snip% get-extent] and
 @method[snip% partial-offset] methods must not make any assumptions
 about the state of the drawing context, except that it is scaled
 properly. In particular, the font for the snip's style is not
 automatically set in the drawing context before the method is
 called. (Many snips cache their size information, so
 automatically setting the font would be wasteful.)  If @method[snip%
 get-extent] or @method[snip% partial-offset] changes the drawing
 context's setting, it must restore them before returning. However,
 the methods should not need to change the drawing context; only font
 settings can affect measurement results from a device context, and
 @xmethod[dc<%> get-text-extent] accepts a @racket[font%] argument for
 sizing that overrides that device context's current font.

The snip's left and top @techlink{location}s are provided as @racket[x]
 and @racket[y] in editor coordinates, in case the snip's size depends
 on its location; the @racket[x] and @racket[y] arguments are usually
 ignored. In a text editor, the @racket[y]-coordinate is the @italic{line's}
 top @techlink{location}; the snip's actual top @techlink{location} is
 potentially undetermined until its height is known.

If a snip caches the result size for future replies, it should
 invalidate its cached size when @method[snip% size-cache-invalid] is
 called (especially if the snip's size depends on any device context
 properties).

If a snip's size changes after receiving a call to
@method[snip% get-extent] and before receiving a call to
@method[snip% size-cache-invalid], then the snip must notify its administrator of the size change, so
 that the administrator can recompute its derived size information.
 Notify the administrator of a size change by call its
@method[snip-admin% resized] method.

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for writing and
 reflowing when this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

                           [y real?]
                           [len exact-nonnegative-integer?])
           real?]{
@methspec{

Calculates a partial width for the snip, starting from the first snip
 @techlink{item} and continuing for @racket[len] @techlink{item}s. The
 drawing context and snip's @techlink{location}s in editor coordinates
 are provided. See also @method[snip% get-extent].

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for writing and
 reflowing when this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

}
@methimpl{

Returns @racket[0.0].

}}


@defmethod[(previous)
           (or/c (is-a?/c snip%) #f)]{

Returns the previous snip in the editor owning this snip, or @racket[#f] if this
 is the first snip.

}


@defmethod[(release-from-owner)
           boolean?]{
@methspec{

Asks the snip to try to release itself from its owner. If the snip is
 not owned or the release is successful, then @racket[#t] is
 returned. Otherwise, @racket[#f] is returned and the snip remains
 owned.  See also @method[snip% is-owned?].

Use this method for moving a snip from one editor to another. This
 method notifies the snip's owning editor that someone else really
 wants control of the snip. It is not necessary to use this method for
 "cleaning up" a snip when it is deleted from an editor.

}
@methimpl{

Requests a low-level release from the snip's owning administrator.

}}


@defmethod[(resize [w (and/c real? (not/c negative?))]
                   [h (and/c real? (not/c negative?))])
           boolean?]{
@methspec{

Resizes the snip. The snip can refuse to be resized by returning
 @racket[#f]. Otherwise, the snip will resize (it must call its
 administrator's @method[snip-admin% resized] method) and return
 @racket[#t].

See also @xmethod[pasteboard% on-interactive-resize].

}
@methimpl{

Returns @racket[#f].

}}


@defmethod[(set-admin [admin (or/c (is-a?/c snip-admin%) #f)])
           void?]{

Sets the snip's administrator. Only an administrator should call this
 method.

The default method sets the internal state of a snip to record its
 administrator. It will not modify this state if the snip is already
 owned by an administrator and the administrator has not blessed the
 transition. If the administrator state of a snip is not modified as
 expected during a sensitive call to this method by an instance of
 @racket[text%] or @racket[pasteboard%], the
 internal state may be forcibly modified (if the new administrator was
 @racket[#f]) or a surrogate snip may be created (if the snip was
 expected to receive a new administrator).

The snip's (new) editor is usually internally locked for reading when
 this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

}


@defmethod[(set-count [c (integer-in 1 100000)])
           void?]{
@methspec{

Sets the snip's @techlink{count} (i.e., the number of @techlink{item}s
 within the snip).

The snip's @techlink{count} may be changed by the system (in extreme cases to
 maintain consistency) without calling this method.

}
@methimpl{

Sets the snip's @techlink{count} and notifies the snip's administrator
 that the snip's size has changed.

}}


@defmethod[(set-flags [flags (listof symbol?)])
           void?]{
@methspec{

Sets the snip's flags. See @method[snip% get-flags].

}
@methimpl{

Sets the snip flags and notifies the snip's editor that its flags have
changed. 

}}


@defmethod[(set-snipclass [class (is-a?/c snip-class%)])
           void?]{

Sets the snip's class, used for file saving and cut-and-paste.

This method stores the snip class internally; other editor objects may
 access the snip class directly, instead of through the @method[snip%
 get-snipclass] method.

}


@defmethod[(set-style [style (is-a?/c style<%>)])
           void?]{

Sets the snip's style if it is not owned by any editor.  See also
 @method[snip% get-style] and @method[snip% is-owned?].

The snip's style may be changed by the system without calling this method.

}


@defmethod[(set-unmodified)
           void?]{
@methspec{

Called by the snip's administrator to notify the snip that its changed
 have been saved. The next time snip's internal state is modified by
 the user, it should call @method[snip-admin% modified] to report the
 state change (but only on the first change after this method is
 called, or the first change after the snip acquires a new
 administrator).

}
@methimpl{

Does nothing.

}}


@defmethod[(size-cache-invalid)
           void?]{

@methspec{

Called to notify the snip that it may need to recalculate its display
 arguments (width, height, etc.) when it is next asked, because the
 style or @techlink{location} of the snip has changed.

The snip's (new) editor is usually internally locked for reflowing
 when this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

}

@methimpl{

Does nothing.

}}


@defmethod[(split [position exact-nonnegative-integer?]
                  [first (box/c (is-a?/c snip%))]
                  [second (box/c (is-a?/c snip%))])
           void?]{

@methspec{
Splits the snip into two snips. This is called when a snip has more
 than one @techlink{item} and something is inserted between two
 @techlink{item}s.

The arguments are a relative @techlink{position} integer and two
 boxes. The @techlink{position} integer specifies how many
 @techlink{item}s should be given to the new first snip; the rest go
 to the new second snip. The two boxes must be filled with two new
 snips. (The old snip is no longer used, so it can be recycled as a
 new snip.)

If the returned snips do not have the expected @techlink{count}s, their
 @techlink{count}s are forcibly modified. If either returned snip is already
 owned by another administrator, a surrogate snip is created.

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for reading when this
 method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).
}

@methimpl{

Creates a new @racket[snip%] instance with @racket[position]
elements, and modifies @this-obj[] to decrement its count by
@racket[position]. The nest snip is installed into @racket[first] and
@this-obj[] is installed into @racket[second].

}}


@defmethod[(write [f (is-a?/c editor-stream-out%)])
           void?]{

Writes the snip to the given stream. (Snip reading is handled by the
 snip class.) Style information about the snip (i.e., the content of
 @method[snip% get-style]) will be saved and restored automatically.

}}
