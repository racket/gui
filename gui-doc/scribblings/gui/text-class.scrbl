@defclass/title[text% object% (editor<%>)]{

A @racket[text%] object is a standard text editor. A text editor is
 displayed on the screen through an @racket[editor-canvas%] object or
 some other @techlink{display}.


@defconstructor[([line-spacing (and/c real? (not/c negative?)) 1.0]
                 [tab-stops (listof real?) null]
                 [auto-wrap any/c #f])]{

The @racket[line-spacing] argument sets the additional amount of space
 (in DC units) inserted between each line in the editor when the
 editor is displayed. This spacing is included in the reported height
 of each line.

See @method[text% set-tabs] for information about @racket[tabstops].

If @racket[auto-wrap] is true, then auto-wrapping is enabled via
 @method[editor<%> auto-wrap].

A new @racket[keymap%] object is created for the new editor.  See also
 @method[editor<%> get-keymap] and @method[editor<%> set-keymap].

A new @racket[style-list%] object is created for the new editor.  See
 also @method[editor<%> get-style-list] and @method[editor<%>
 set-style-list].

Changes the style for a region in the editor by applying a style delta
 or installing a specific style.  If @racket[start] is @racket['start]
 and @racket[end] is @racket['end], then the currently selected
 @techlink{item}s are changed. Otherwise, if @racket[end] is
 @racket['end], then the style is changed from @racket[start] until
 the end of the selection.  If @racket[counts-as-mod?] is @racket[#f],
 then @method[editor<%> set-modified] is not called after applying the
 style change.

To change a large collection of snips from one style to another style,
 consider providing a @racket[style<%>] instance rather than a
 @racket[style-delta%] instance. Otherwise, @method[text%
 change-style] must convert the @racket[style-delta%] instance to the
 @racket[style<%>] instance for every snip; this conversion consumes
 both time and (temporary) memory.

 If the string is not found, @racket[#f] is returned.

The @racket[direction] argument can be @racket['forward] or
 @racket['backward], indicating a forward search or backward

 the ending @techlink{position} is returned.  However, if @racket[get-start?] is
 @racket[#f], then the other end of the string @techlink{position} will be
 returned.

The @racket[start] and @racket[end] arguments set the starting and ending
 @techlink{position}s of a forward search (use @racket[start] > @racket[end] for a
 backward search). If @racket[start] is @racket['start], then the search
 starts at the start of the selection. If @racket[end] is @racket['eof],
 then the search continues to the end (for a forward search) or start

           void?]{

Finds wordbreaks in the editor using the current wordbreak procedure.
 See also @method[text% set-wordbreak-func].

The contents of the @racket[start] argument specifies an @techlink{position} to start
 searching backwards to the next word start; its will be filled with
 the starting @techlink{position} of the word that is found.  If @racket[start] is
 @racket[#f], no backward search is performed.

The contents of the @racket[end] argument specifies an @techlink{position} to start
 searching forwards to the next word end; its will be filled with the
 ending @techlink{position} of the word that is found.  If @racket[end] is
 @racket[#f], no forward search is performed.

The @racket[reason] argument specifies more information about what the
 wordbreak is used for. For example, the wordbreaks used to move the
 caret may be different from the wordbreaks used to break lines. The
 possible values of @racket[reason] are:

@itemize[
@item{@racket['caret] --- find a wordbreak suitable for moving the caret}
@item{@racket['line] --- find a wordbreak suitable for breaking lines}
@item{@racket['selection] --- find a wordbreak suitable for selecting the closest word}
@item{@racket['user1] --- for other (not built-in) uses}
@item{@racket['user2] --- for other (not built-in) uses}
]

The actual handling of @racket[reason] is controlled by the current
 wordbreak procedure; see @method[text% set-wordbreak-func]for
 details. The default handler and default wordbreak map treats
 alphanumeric characters the same for @racket['caret], @racket['line],
 and @racket['selection]. Non-alphanumeric, non-space, non-hyphen
 characters do not break lines, but do break caret and selection
 words.  For example a comma should not be counted as part of the
 preceding word for moving the caret past the word or double-clicking
 the word, but the comma should stay on the same line as the word (and
 thus counts in the same ``line word'').

@defmethod[(get-styles-sticky)
           boolean?]{

In the normal mode for a text editor, style settings are sticky. With
 sticky styles, when a string or character is inserted into an editor,
 it gets the style of the snip preceding the insertion point (or the
 snip that includes the insertion point if text is inserted into an
 exiting string snip). Alternatively, if @method[text% change-style]
 is called to set the style at the caret @techlink{position} (when it
 is not a range), then the style is remembered; if the editor is not
 changed before text is inserted at the caret, then the text gets the
 remembered style.

 style in the editor's style list named by @method[editor<%>

To calculate lines, if the following are true:
@itemize[

 @item{the editor is not displayed (see @secref["tb:miaoverview"]),}

 @item{a maximum width is set for the editor, and} 

 @item{the editor has never been viewed}

]

then this method ignores the editor's maximum width and any automatic
 line breaks it might imply.  If the first two of the above conditions
 are true and the editor was @italic{formerly} displayed, this method
 uses the line breaks from the most recent display of the
 editor. (Insertions or deletions since the display shift line breaks
 within the editor in the same way as @techlink{item}s.)

Editors collectively maintain a copy ring that holds up to 30 previous

 the copy ring, incrementing the ring pointer so that the next
 @method[text% paste-next] pastes in even older data.

It is a copy ``ring'' because the ring pointer wraps back to the most
 recent copied data after the oldest remembered data is pasted. Any
 cut, copy, or (regular) paste operation resets the copy ring pointer
 back to the beginning.

If the previous operation on the editor was not a paste, calling
 @method[text% paste-next] has no effect.

Installs a clickback for a given region. If a clickback is already
 installed for an overlapping region, this clickback takes precedence.

The callback procedure @racket[f] is called when the user selects the
 clickback. The arguments to @racket[f] are this editor and the starting
 and ending range of the clickback.

The @racket[hilite-delta] style delta is applied to the clickback text
 when the user has clicked and is still holding the mouse over the
 clickback. If @racket[hilite-delta] is @racket[#f], then the clickback
 region's style is not changed when it is being selected.

If @racket[call-on-down?] is not @racket[#f], the clickback is called
 immediately when the user clicks the mouse button down, instead of
 after a mouse-up event. The @racket[hilite-delta] argument is not used
 in this case.

@defmethod[(set-line-spacing [space (and/c real? (not/c negative?))])

           void?]{

Sets padding that insets the editor's content when drawn within its
@techlink{display}.

Unlike any margin that may be applied by the editor's
@techlink{display}, padding is counted in @techlink{location}
information that is reported by methods such as @method[text%
position-location]. For example, with a @racket[left] padding of 17.0
and a @racket[top] padding of 9.0, the location of position 0 will be
(17.0, 9.0) rather than (0, 0). Padding also contributes to the
editor's size as reported by @method[editor<%> get-extent].}


@defmethod[(set-paragraph-alignment [paragraph exact-nonnegative-integer?]
                                    [alignment (or/c 'left 'center 'right)])
           void?]{

Sets a paragraph-specific horizontal alignment. The alignment is only
 used when the editor has a maximum width, as set with
 @method[editor<%> set-max-width]. @|ParagraphNumbering|

@italic{This method is experimental.} It works reliably only when the
 paragraph is not merged or split. Merging or splitting a paragraph
 with alignment settings causes the settings to be transferred
 unpredictably (although other paragraphs in the editor can be safely
 split or merged). If the last paragraph in an editor is empty,
 settings assigned to it are ignored.

Sets a paragraph-specific margin. @|ParagraphNumbering|

The first line of the paragraph is indented by @racket[first-left] points
 within the editor. If the paragraph is line-wrapped (when the editor
 has a maximum width), subsequent lines are indented by @racket[left]
 points.  If the editor has a maximum width, the paragraph's maximum
 width for line-wrapping is @racket[right] points smaller than the
 editor's maximum width.

@italic{This method is experimental.} See @method[text%

Sets the current selection in the editor. 

If @racket[end] is @racket['same] or less than or equal to @racket[start],
 the current start and end @techlink{position}s are both set to
 @racket[start]. Otherwise the given range is selected.

See @|ateoldiscuss| for a discussion of @racket[at-eol?]. If
 @racket[scroll?]  is not @racket[#f], then the @techlink{display} is
 scrolled to show the selection if necessary.

The @racket[seltype] argument is only used when the X Window System
 selection mechanism is enabled. The possible values are:
@itemize[

 @item{@racket['default] --- if this window has the keyboard focus
 and given selection is non-empty, make it the current X selection}

 @item{@racket['x] --- if the given selection is non-empty, make
 it the current X selection}

 @item{@racket['local] --- do not change the
 current X selection}

]

Setting the @techlink{position} is disallowed when the editor is internally
 locked for reflowing (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

The system may change the selection in an editor without calling this
 method (or any visible method).

           void?]{

Sets the tabbing array for the editor.

The @racket[tabs] list determines the tabbing array. The tabbing array
 specifies the x-@techlink{location}s where each tab occurs. Tabs beyond the last
 specified tab are separated by a fixed amount @racket[tab-width].  If
 @racket[in-units?] is not @racket[#f], then tabs are specified in canvas
 units; otherwise, they are specified as a number of spaces. (If tabs
 are specified in spaces, then the graphic tab positions will change
 with the font used for the tab.)

Setting tabs is disallowed when the editor is internally locked for
 reflowing (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

Sets the word-breaking function for the editor.  For information about
 the arguments to the word-breaking function, see @method[text%
 find-wordbreak].

The standard wordbreaking function uses the editor's
 @racket[editor-wordbreak-map%] object to determine which characters
 break a word. See also @racket[editor-wordbreak-map%] and
 @method[text% set-wordbreak-map].

Since the wordbreak function will be called when line breaks are being
 determined (in an editor that has a maximum width), there is a
 constrained set of @racket[text%] methods that the wordbreak
 function is allowed to invoke. It cannot invoke a member function
 that uses information about @techlink{location}s or lines (which are
 identified in this manual with ``@|OVD|''), but it can still invoke
 member functions that work with snips and @techlink{item}s.

}

           void?]{

Sets the wordbreaking map that is used by the standard wordbreaking
