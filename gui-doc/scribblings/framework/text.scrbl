                 void?
                 (-> void?))]{
    This function highlights a region of text in the buffer.

    The range between @racket[start] and @racket[end] will be highlighted with
    the given @racket[color], if the style is @racket['rectangle] (the default).  If
    the style is @racket['ellipse], then an ellipse is drawn around the range
    in the editor, using the color.  If the style is @racket['hollow-ellipse],
    then the outline of an ellipse is drawn around the range in the editor,
    using the color.

    If the style is @racket['dot], then @racket[start] and @racket[end] must be
    the same, and a dot is drawn at the bottom of that position in the editor.

    If @racket[caret-space?] is not @racket[#f], the left edge of the range
    will be one pixel short, to leave space for the caret. The caret does not
    interfere with the right hand side of the range. Note that under some
    platforms, the caret is drawn with XOR, which means almost anything can
    happen. So if the caret is in the middle of the range it may be hard to
    see, or if it is on the left of the range and @racket[caret-space?] is
    @racket[#f] it may also be hard to see.

    The @racket[priority] argument indicates the relative priority for drawing
    overlapping regions. If two regions overlap and have different priorities,
    the region with @racket['high] priority will be drawn second and only it
    will be visible in the overlapping region.

    If @racket[adjust-on-insert/delete?] is @racket[#t], then insertions
    and deletions to the text will adjust the @racket[start] and @racket[end]
    of the range. Insertions and deletions before the range move the range forward
    and backward; insertions and deletions after the range will be ignored. An insertion
    in the middle of the range will enlarge the range and a deletion that overlaps
    the range adjusts the range to reflect the deleted portion of the range and its
    new position.
    
    The @racket[key] argument can be used with 
    @method[text:basic<%> unhighlight-ranges/key]
    and 
    @method[text:basic<%> unhighlight-ranges]
    to identify ranges whose start and end positions may have changed.
    Symbols whose names begin with @litchar{plt:} are reserved
    for internal use.
    
    If this method returns a thunk, invoking the thunk will turn off the
    highlighting from this range.

    Note that if @racket[adjust-on-insert/delete] is a true value, then
    the result is not a thunk and instead 
    @method[text:basic<%> unhighlight-range],
    @method[text:basic<%> unhighlight-ranges/key], or
    @method[text:basic<%> unhighlight-ranges]
    must be called directly to remove the highlighting.
