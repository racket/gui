_MysterX_
=========

 MysterX is a toolkit for building Windows applications from
 ActiveX and COM components.  Dynamic HTML is used for
 component presentation and event-handling.  MysterX
 requires Internet Explorer 4 or 5 (IE) to be installed.
 Distributed COM (DCOM) for your version of Windows is also 
 required.  Windows NT comes with DCOM, while versions of
 DCOM for Windows 95 and 98 are made available separately.  
 IE and DCOM are available for download from the
 Microsoft Web site, http://www.microsoft.com/.

 Installation
 ------------

 Three Windows .DLL's support low-level operations in MysterX.  
 Two of them, myspage.dll and myssink.dll, may need to be 
 installed in the Registry, by entering `REGSVR32 <name-of-DLL>'.  
 REGSVR32 is a Windows utility usually found in the Windows 
 System directory.  The .DLL's are found in the dlls subdirectory 
 of the MysterX collection.  Ordinarily, the PLT installation 
 program registers these .DLL's, but if the files are copied, or 
 Windows is installed in an unusual disk location, manual registration 
 becomes necessary.  The third .DLL,  mxmain.dll, is loaded as a 
 MzScheme extension by the file `mysterx.ss' in the mysterx 
 collection. 

 Loading
 -------

 There are two ways to load MysterX.  The first is to treat
 MysterX as a library:  

  (require-library "mysterx.ss" "mysterx")

 makes available the procedures listed here.  The other way
 to load MysterX uses a signed unit: 

  (require-library "mysterxu.ss" "mysterx")

 binds `mysterx@' to the unit, with signature `mysterx^',
 which is defined in the file `sigs.ss' in the mysterx collection.
 This unit can be invoked or imported into other units as needed.

 Using the xml collection
 ------------------------

 Several MysterX procedures take HTML strings as input.  
 The xml collection provides procedures that convert Scheme
 syntax into XML strings.  You may find using these procedures 
 useful in creating HTML strings for use by MysterX. 

 MysterX provides direct access to some of the XML collection
 with the procedure xexp->string:

> (xexp->string xexp)

 Translates the X-expression `xexpr' to a string.  See the
 XML collection for details of X-expressions.  This procedure
 is useful with the methods insert-html, append-html, and 
 replace-html of mx-document%, and the same-named methods 
 of mx-element%.
 
 Documents
 ---------

 A MysterX application consists of one or more documents, which are
 instances of the class mx-document%. 

> mx-document% :: (make-object mx-document% label width height x y style-list)

  Creates an instance of a MysterX document.  `label' is a string for the 
  document caption, with default "MysterX".  `width', `height', `x', and 
  `y' give the size and placement of the document on the desktop, 
  with defaults provided by Windows if omitted.  `style-list' may contain 
  any of the symbols 'iconize, 'maximize, 'no-caption, 'no-system-menu, 
  and 'no-thick-border.

  Methods
  -------

> show :: (send an-mx-document show b)

  If `b' is #f, the document window is hidden.  Otherwise, the window is shown.

  are called in a thread separate from the main MzScheme REPL.

> stop-handling-events :: (send an-mx-document stop-handling-events)

  Kills the thread currently handling events for the document.

> insert-object :: (send an-mx-document insert-object coclass width height [size])

  Inserts a COM object with class `coclass' at the beginning of the 
  document.  `width' and `height' are fixnum integers.  The optional 
  `size' argument gives an interpretation for the width and height.  
  By default, size is 'pixels, but may also be 'percent, indicating that 
  the width and height are a fixed percentage of the document window size.
  An instance of <com-object> is returned.

> append-object :: (send an-mx-document append-object coclass)

  Append a COM object with class `coclass' to the end of the document.  
  `width' and `height' are fixnum integers.  The optional 
  `size' argument gives an interpretation for the width and height.  
  By default, size is 'pixels, but may also be 'percent, indicating that 
  the width and height are a fixed percentage of the document window size.
  An instance of <com-object> is returned.

> find-element :: (send an-mx-document find-element tag id)

  Returns an instance of mx-element%, an object which encapsulates
  an HTML element.  `tag' is a string naming an HTML tag, and
  `id' is a string naming the id attribute of the HTML element.

  HTML events
  -----------

  MysterX HTML events are generated by mouse and keyboard interaction 
  with HTML elements in a document.  HTML events are instances of the 
  class mx-event%.  The action that generated an event can be determined 
  by the following predicates, only one of which may hold:

> keypress? :: (send an-mx-event keypress?)
> keydown? :: (send an-mx-event event-keydown?) 
> keyup? :: (send an-mx-event keyup?)

  COM methods and properties
  --------------------------

  MysterX allows scripting of most COM components from Scheme.  A COM
component can be scripted in MysterX if 1) it supports OLE Automation, 
that is, the IDispatch interface, and 2) publishes type information using
the ITypeInfo interface.

  `a-coclass` is the name of a COM class.  Returns an instance
  of the class, of type <com-object>.  Useful for COM classes 
  without a visual representation, or when a visual representation 
  is not needed.    

> (com-methods a-com-object)
> (com-methods a-com-type)

  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>.  `a-com-type' is a <com-type>.  Returns 
   a list of strings indicating the names of methods.

  `method-name' is a string.  Returns a list 
  of symbols indicating the type of the specified method.

> (com-invoke a-com-object method-name ...)

  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>, and `method-name' is a string.  Invokes 
  the requested method using the arguments given.  The special value 
  `com-omit' may be used for optional arguments, useful when values 
  are supplied for arguments to the right of the omitted argument(s).

> (com-get-properties a-com-object)
> (com-get-properties a-com-type)

  `a-com-object' has type <com-object>.  `a-com-type' is a <com-type>.  
  Returns a list of strings indicating the names of readable properties 
  in the object.

> (com-get-property-type a-com-object property-name)
> (com-get-property-type a-com-type property-name)

  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>, `a-com-type' is a <com-type>, 
  and `property-name' is a string.  Returns a list of symbols indicating
  the type of the specified property.

> (com-get-property a-com-object property-name)

  Returns a list of strings indicating the names of writable properties 
  in the object.

> (com-set-property-type a-com-object property-name)
> (com-set-property-type a-com-type property-name)

  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>, `a-com-type' is a <com-type>, and 
  `property-name' is a string.  Returns a list of symbols indicating 
  the type of the specified property.

> (com-set-property! a-com-object property-name val)

  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>, `property-name' is a string, and 
  `val' is a value of suitable type.  Sets the value of the specified 
  property.

> (com-help a-com-object topic)
> (com-help a-com-type topic)

  Starts the Window Help system with help about the COM object
  or COM type.  `a-com-object' is a <com-object>, `a-com-type' 
  is a <com-type>, and `topic' is an optional string,
  typically a method or property name.

  Returns #t if the two COM objects are the same, #f otherwise.

> (com-object? a-com-object)

  Returns #t if the argument is a COM object, #f otherwise.

  COM events
  -----------

  COM events are generated by COM objects.  Unlike HTML events, 
  there is no fixed set of COM events, though there are
  "stock" events that many COM objects support.  MysterX
  allows the programmer to write handlers for both stock 
  and custom events.

> (com-events a-com-object)
> (com-events a-com-type)

  Returns a list of strings naming the events supported by the
  COM object `a-com-object' or the COM type `a-com-type'.
 
> (com-event-type a-com-object ev)
> (com-event-type a-com-type ev)

  Returns the type of an event handler for the event ev, a string, 
  generated by the particular COM object `a-com-object', or by 
  COM objects that have type `a-com-type'.  The return type of all
  COM event handlers is void.

> (com-register-event-handler a-com-object ev fn)

  Registers the event handler fn, a procedure, to handle the event 
  ev, a string, when generated by the COM object `a-com-object'.
  The input type of `fn' depends on the event.  `fn' may have any 
  output type, though its output is always discarded.

> (com-unregister-event-handler a-com-object ev)

  Unregisters any event handler for the event ev, a string, that 
  is generated by the COM object `a-com-object'.

  MysterX types
  -------------

  There are a few special types that appear in the types of COM component
  methods and properties.  

> boolean

  A boolean.  When a boolean is required in argument position, MysterX 
  will interpret #f as false, and any other value as true.

> short-int

  A 16-bit integer, with value -32768 <= n <= 32767.

> mx-currency

  A currency value.  Currently, there is no way to construct such values,
  though they may be returned by COM objects.
  
> mx-date

  A date value.  Currently, there is no way to construct such values,
  though they may be returned by COM objects.
  
> mx-scode

  An error value.  Currently, there is no way to construct such values,
  though they may be returned by COM objects.
  
> mx-unknown-com-object

  An interface pointer for a COM object.  Currently, there is no way to 
  construct such values, though they may be returned by COM objects.
  
> mx-any

  A method or property requiring a value of mx-any will accept values 
  of any of these Scheme types: char, int, float, real, and string,
  as well as the values #t and #f, as well as values of the COM-specific
  types <mx-currency>, <mx-date>, <mx-scode>, and <mx-unknown-com-object>.

  HTML and Dynamic HTML support
  -----------------------------

> (coclass->html name width height [size])

  Returns a string containing HTML which when inserted into a document loads
  the COM object given by `name'.  This procedure is suitable for placing
  ActiveX controls within complex HTML.  `width' and `height' are
  fixnum integers.  The optional `size' argument gives an interpretation 
  for the width and height.  By default, size is 'pixels, but may also 
  be 'percent, indicating that the width and height are a fixed percentage 
  of the document window size.

  HTML elements 
  -------------

  The mx-element% class encapsulates HTML elements.  By calling 
  the methods of this class, you can change the appearance of 
  elements, and place new HTML before or after the element.
  While the methods are described here, a good DHTML reference,
  such as D. Goodman, "Dynamic HTML" will have more complete
  information.

  In the following method descriptions, "CSS" refers to the 
  Cascading Style Sheets specification.  A CSS length is string 
  consisting of a decimal integer number followed by one of the 
  units "px" (pixels), "em" (font height), "ex" (height of an "x"),
  "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), "mm" (millimeters),
  "pi" (picas), or "pt" (points).  A CSS percentage is a string 
  consisting of a decimal real number followed by "%".

> append-html :: (send an-mx-element append-html html)

  Places the HTML given by the string `html' after the element.

> replace-html :: (send an-mx-element replace-html html)

  Replaces the HTML in the element with the string `html'.  You must 
  use the `find-element' method of mx-document% to retrieve the
  updated element.
  
> insert-text :: (send an-mx-element insert-text txt)

  Places the text given by the string `txt' before the HTML element.
  
> append-text :: (send an-mx-element append-text txt)

  Places the text given by the string `txt' after the HTML element.
  
> insert-object :: (send an-mx-element insert-object coclass width height [size])

  Inserts a COM object with class `coclass' before the HTML element.
  `width' and `height' are fixnum integers.  The optional `size' argument 
  gives an interpretation for the width and height.  By default, size 
  is 'pixels, but may also be 'percent, indicating that the width and 
  height are a fixed percentage of the document window size.
  An instance of <com-object> is returned.

> append-object :: (send an-mx-element append-object coclass width height [size])

  Places a COM object with class `coclass' after the HTML element.  
  `width' and `height' are fixnum integers.  The optional `size' argument 
  gives an interpretation for the width and height.  By default, size 
  is 'pixels, but may also be 'percent, indicating that the width and 
  height are a fixed percentage of the document window size.
  An instance of <com-object> is returned.
